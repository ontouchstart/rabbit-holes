# Interactive computing is NOT WYSIWYG
Thirty years later, I realized that the excitement I experienced at the UNIX tools class
was actually about interactive computing.
Every keystroke I typed, every output the terminal printed, every mistake I made and fixed had huge impact on me.

Somehow along the way, this interactivity was replaced by the concept of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).

We moved from Typewriters to Word Processors.
Editor as a profession becomes editor as a machine, just like Computer as a profession becomes computer as a machine.

## APL demonstration 1975

Here is an example of non-WYSIWIG interactive computer with [typewriter terminal](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Typewriter_terminal).
