# What is missing now
Our machines are orders of magnitude more powerful and we take orders 
of magnitude effort to accomplish the same tasks.
We lost our muscle memory as well as real memory. We copy and paste but
forgot what we have copied and where we copied from. We don't stop and think
about why and how. 

More importantly, we let machine to automate the repetitive task
and forget that **repetition is the mother of learning**.
