# Why missing

When I was a Physics Ph.D. student in NYU in the late nineties, I took a
course called UNIX tools in the CS department. It was a hands on course where
the instructor did live REPL in the terminal and we watched him showing us all
the tricks. I got hooked with UNIX since then. Got myself a dialup terminal in
my tiny apartment in east village and dial in to the workstation on campus.
The latency is so bad that I can’t only see the feedback after a few
keystrokes. That was when I trained my vi muscle memory. (EMacs was out of the
question.)

Later I got my own IBM 386 and installed Linux on it and started to program in
Perl …

I am a big fan of Jon’s YouTube videos on Rust and I started to use Rust in
non conventional ways.

I am going to follow this lecture series and “port” them to rustdoc and see
how it goes.
