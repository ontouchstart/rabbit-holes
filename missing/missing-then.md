# What was missing then
Back then I only had a dummy terminal without GUI. Not enough memory
or bandwidth to run IDEs like Emacs with sophisticated key binding and buffers.
Even copy and paste was hard. So I have to type the command by hand, no tab completion.

Note: as a matter of fact, we don't even need an editor to create text files,
the text above was not inserted by an editor, although following is done via `vi` to save time:

```sh
cat <<EOF >> missing/missing-then.md
heredoc> Back then I only had a dummy terminal without GUI. Not enough memory

heredoc> EOF
```
