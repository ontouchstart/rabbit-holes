```code
procedure	quicksort (A,M,N);	value M,N;
		array A;	integer M,N;
```

__comment__ Quicksort is a very fast and convenient method of
sorting an array in the random-access store of a computer. The
entire contents of the store may be sorted, since no extra space is
required. The average number of comparisons made is `2(M-N) ln(N-M)`,
and the average number of exchanges is one sixth this amount.
Suitable refinements of this method will be desirable for
its implementation on any actual computer. 

```code
begin	integer I,J;
	if M < N	then	begin	partition (A,M,N,I,J);      
					quicksort(A,M,J);
					quicksort(A,I,N)
				end
end	quicksort
```
