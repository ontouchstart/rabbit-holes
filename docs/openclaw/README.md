Turned out to be a quite interesting interview.

## More and Faster

This is the key issue. Symptoms or causes? 

### Questions 
- Why do we want more and faster? 
- What do we really want? 
- What do we really need?
- Do we really have options and choices?
- Can we fight the temptation or tide? 

### Happy ending?
