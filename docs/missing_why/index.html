<p>When I was a Physics Ph.D. student in NYU in the late nineties, I took a
course called UNIX tools in the CS department. It was a hands on course where
the instructor did live REPL in the terminal and we watched him showing us all
the tricks. I got hooked with UNIX since then. Got myself a dialup terminal in
my tiny apartment in east village and dial in to the workstation on campus.
The latency is so bad that I can’t only see the feedback after a few
keystrokes. That was when I trained my vi muscle memory. (EMacs was out of the
question.)</p>
<p>Later I got my own IBM 386 and installed Linux on it and started to program in
Perl …</p>
<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo/videos">Jon’s YouTube
videos</a> on Rust and I started to use
Rust in non conventional ways.</p>
<p>I am going to follow this lecture series and “port” them to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/">rustdoc</a> and see how it goes.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-missing-then"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#what-was-missing-then">§</a>What was missing then</h2>
<p>Back then I only had a dumb terminal without GUI. Not enough memory
or bandwidth to run IDEs like Emacs with sophisticated key binding and buffers.
Even copy and paste was hard. So I have to type the command by hand, no tab completion.</p>
<p>Note: as a matter of fact, we don’t even need an editor to create text files,
the text above was not inserted by an editor, although following is done via <code>vi</code> to save time:</p>
<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="language-sh"><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; missing/missing-then.md

<p>Our machines are orders of magnitude more powerful and we take orders
of magnitude effort to accomplish the same tasks.
We lost our muscle memory as well as real memory. We copy and paste but
forgot what we have copied and where we copied from. We don’t stop and think
about why and <a href="../missing_how/index.html">how</a>.</p>
<p>More importantly, we let machine to automate the repetitive task
and forget that <strong>repetition is the mother of learning</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="interactive-computing-is-not-wysiwyg"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#interactive-computing-is-not-wysiwyg">§</a>Interactive computing is NOT WYSIWYG</h2>
<p>Thirty years later, I realized that the excitement I experienced at the UNIX
tools class was actually about interactive computing.  Every keystroke I
typed, every output the terminal printed, every mistake I made and fixed had
huge impact on me.</p>
<p>Somehow along the way, this interactivity was replaced by the concept of
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).</p>
<p>We moved from Typewriters to Word Processors.  Editor as a profession becomes
editor as a machine, just like Computer as a profession becomes computer as a
machine.</p>
<h3 id="apl-demonstration-1975"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#apl-demonstration-1975">§</a>APL demonstration 1975</h3>
<p>Here is an example of non-WYSIWIG interactive computing with <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Typewriter_terminal">typewriter
terminal</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt of <a href="https://www.arraycast.com/2024/11/09/Dr-Ken-Iverson.html">Interview with Dr. Ken Iverson
(1982)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a printing terminal, and so it sounds and looks just like a typewriter.
It’s not what most people use these days. I still find it the most
convenient, although I use the others as well, primarily because a lot of
the work that I do, I want to be able to actually have it printed, rip it
off, lay it on my desk, and pour over it and modify it and so on. And to do
the equivalent thing with the screens, the cathode ray tube screens, I don’t
find anywhere near as convenient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is not batch computing in the sense of submitting a deck of punch cards
to the machine and waiting for the output but interactive workflow like a
writer typing on a typewriter, reviewing, making corrections and repeating.
This process is also called Read-Eval-Print Loop
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>).</p>
<p>Another interesting side effect of this workflow is that it distinguishes
<strong>input</strong> from <strong>output</strong>. In UNIX system, the concepts of <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>
and <code>stderr</code> are not just for machine operation, but also for the user to make
a distinguish between them and therefore to have a concept of dataflow. This
becomes the foundation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">UNIX
pipe</a>.</p>
